                <div id="AboutMidinf" class="AboutMidinf">Kenya lies astride the equator on the eastern coast of Africa. It is a medium-sized country by continental standards, covering an area of about 586,600km sq. Inland water bodies cover some 10,700km sq, the bulk of this in Lakes Victoria and Turkana. 

Kenya has tremendous topographical diversity, including <span style="text-decoration:underline">glaciated mountains with snow-capped peaks</span>, the Rift Valley with its scarps and volcanoes, ancient granitic hills, <span style="text-decoration:underline">flat desert landscapes </span>and coral reefs and islets.  

<strong style="text-decoration:underline; color:#b21616;">LAND OF 7th WONDER OF THE WORLD.</strong>

Take this special scenic safari through Kenya and discover views and vistas beyond your wildest dreams. Using Ipix technology, this safari will take you through a world of astonishing contrasts, all within the borders of a single country
Kenya is the home of the safari.<br />
The boundless wilderness and big game of this region has long attracted adventure seekers from all over the globe. No other African country can boast such an incredible range of landscapes, unique geographical features and species.<br />
<span class="abtHstyle">Maasai Mara, Kenya </span><br /> 
The Game Reserve is widely considered to be Africa’s greatest wildlife reserve. The Mara comprises200 sq miles of open plains, woodlands and riverine forest. Contiguous with the plains of the Serengeti, the Mara is home to a breath taking array of life. 
The vast grassland plains are scattered with herds of Zebra, Giraffe, Gazelle, and Topi. <br />The Acacia forests abound with Bird life and Monkeys. Elephants and Buffalo wallow in the wide Musiara Swamp. The Mara and Talek rivers are brimming with Hippos and Crocodiles.
<p><span class="abtHstyle">Amboseli</span><br />
  Amboseli is part of Southern Kenyan Maasai land. Proximity  to the border means that many of the Maasai in this area move back and forth  with their herds into Tanzania.Many of the lodges and camps in this area work closely with local Maasai communities. Arrangements can often be made to walk with local Maasai guides or visit Maasai villages, schools and communities around the Park. This is the perfect opportunity to meet and spend time with Maasai people.Amboseli  is surrounded by many Maasaisettlements. The small town of Oloitokitok  (pronounced Loytoktok) is a major Maasaicentre, with fantastic views of Mt  Kilimanjaro. The town hosts huge bustling markets that attract many Maasai from surrounding areas, turning the streets into a sea of bright red shukkas.<br />
  <span class="abtHstyle">Mt.Kilimanjaro </span><br />
Rising 4800m above the East African plains, 270km from the shores of the Indian Ocean and measuring up to 40km across, Kilimanjaro is a bizarre geological oddity, the tallest freestanding mountain in the world and one formed, shaped, eroded and scarred by the twin forces of fire and ice. It is actually a volcano, or rather three volcanoes, with the two main peaks, Kibo and Mawenzi, the summits of two of those volcanoes.<br />
<span class="abtHstyle">Mt.Kenya.</span></p>
           	  </div>
            
				<div id="abtMsa" class="ProppCont">
Mt Kenya, Africa’s second highest peak is regarded as the realm of Ngai, god of the local Kikuyu people. Traditionally, all Kikuyu home were built to face this sacred peak. They call it Kirinyaga, or place of light.  
The mountain is an awe-inspiring sight. Its ragged series of peaks are crowned with snow, and its slopes are thick with forest. The mountain is best seen at dawn, when the days early light silhouettes its impressive summit high over the surrounding plains.<br />
<span class="abtHstyle">The Rift Valley</span><br />
The Rift Valley is one of the wonders of the world, stretching from the Middle East, down through Africa, reaching as far as Mozambique. The staggering view, as you approach from Nairobi, Kenya is quite unbelievable. The ground suddenly disappears from under you to show the huge expanse of the great rift, stretching for thousands of miles in either direction. Whilst this stunning introduction to the Rift valley is amazing in itself, actually descending and exploring the Lakes area of the Rift in Kenya is a "not to be missed" opportunity.<br /><span class="abtHstyle">ITEN KENYAS HOME OF CHAMPION.</span><br />
Sitting at the heart of the Great Rift Valley, just a few kilometers from Eldoret town and considered the Mecca of athletics is the Kipchoge Keino High performance Training camp. 

It is located on a farm owned by legendary Kenyan track star and is designated as an approved high altitude training facility by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Numerous international athletes troop there to train in an annual ritual. Some of the top athletes who have trained here in the past include South Africa’s Ezekiel Sepeng, Olympic 3000m gold medalist Ezekiel Kemboi and top 1500m runner, Daniel Komen (junior).

What started off as a modest facility is now well known within the annals of the IOC, and the international athletic community.In total close to 100 athletes from different countries and backgrounds train at this facility annually in the full glare of both the local and international media.

The state of the art camp provides everything an athlete needs for training. Quality accommodation, conference facilities, a modern gymnasium, a good training ground, a library and a well managed diet are all at the disposal of the athletes.


But why would foreign athletes want to train in Iten? The high altitude makes the area malaria free, hence attracting many foreigners keen on training in the country. The serenity and good terrain also makes Iten a perfect training ground. <br /><span class="abtHstyle">Kenya's Climate</span><br />
Kenya is generally a dry country; over75% of its area is classed as arid of semi-arid with only around 20% being viable for agriculture. 
Inland, rainfall and temperatures are closely related to altitude changes, with variations induced by local topography.
